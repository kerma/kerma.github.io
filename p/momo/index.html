# 1: Know the difference

class: theme
## John:

* 9 years on the field
* worked for 3 companies
* knows all about writing "business software"
--

* <span style="color: red">doesn't know how his software works on production</span>

--

## Jane:
* 4 years on the field
* worked for 3 companies
* knows PHP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Node, JS all the frameworks that came out yesterday
--

* <span style="color: red">doesn't know what left join is</span>

???
Although the first has experience and the second has pontential and 
interest, could they be considered senior?

???
* qualifications of a senior developer cannot be measured in years
or the amount of frameworks one has rewritten her blog in
* it's about knowledge and being able to reflect on your experience

# 3: Understand the full spectrum

```
"A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion,
butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet,
balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying,
take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations,
analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a
tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. 
Specialization is for insects."

â€” Robert Heinlein, Time Enough for Love
