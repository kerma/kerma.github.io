* In physics, The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant.
* Interestngly enough this also works in nutrition.

* .. as he lived off not much more than Twinkies for a month and lost many pounds.
* however I wouldn't recommend that. 
* There are many different arguments over what is healthy and what is not and they
differ most of the part completely: high carb, low carb, atkins, paleo, vegeterian, vegan etc etc
* but science agrees on one thing

# Cardio makes you hungry
???
* Your body uses glucose as the primary source of energy
* glucose is stored in your body as clycogen
* but your body can hold only couple of hours worth of clycogen
* If the resource is depleted your blood sugar levels are very low
and you feel unable to do much
* It's very easy to feel low blood sugar levels while doing chronic cardio
typo of activity
* Which means that you feel considerable hunger after your workout, and this
causes over-eating

* we are born to run you even might say
* just like the story about Micha True, who could run 270 km a week
for the most of his life

* Science seems to agree. Chronic cardio is bad for you health

# Muscle Matters (1)
## Avoid leptin resistance
???
* In a verfy simplified terms, Leptin is a signal sent from your fat cells
to your brain, that stop eating pal, there is enough of us already. 
* Sadly, too much fat makes this signal go weaker or get lost completely.
* And you eat to much cause you feel hungry
* Leptin is also produced by your muscles, the difference being that  more 
muscle doesn't surpress the signal and in some cases makes it even stronger.

# Muscle Matters (2)
## Avoid Sarcopenia, avoid death
### 
???
* Sarcopenia is degenerative loss of skeletal muscle mass after the age of 50
* If you don't have much muscle to loose your life after 50 will become a nightmare.
* Broken bones, fast weight gain due to decreased metabolic rate, 
completely gone sex drive due to loss of testosterone etc etc
* Muscular strength was independently associated with risk of death 
from all causes and cancer in men.

# HIIT / SIT
???
* if you absolutely still cannot lift, like you have no arms or something,
then replace your cardio with High Intensity Interval Training. Or as it's
more known in science world - Sprint Interval Training
---

## Twelve Weeks of Sprint Interval Training Improves Indices of Cardiometabolic Health Similar to Traditional Endurance Training despite a Five-Fold Lower Exercise Volume and Time Commitment
2016, Jenna B. Gillen, Brian J. Martin, Martin J. MacInnis, Lauren E. Skelly, Mark A. Tarnopolsky, Martin J. Gibala
???
* instead of spending hours a week doing boring cardio, do three 20m 
sessions of SIT in a week and be done with it. 
In addition to saving you ton of time, you'll get the benefit on elevated 
"after-burn" effect, you don't feel that hungry (maybe even want to puke instead), 
you wont lose muscle, and you'll get a bigger heart.
