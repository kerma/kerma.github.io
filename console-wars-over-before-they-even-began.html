<p>By the end of this year Sony has launched their new PlayStation 4 and
Microsoft their new Xbox One. I've always been a Xbox user and haven't
ever really understood PS's strange controller and ugly user interface, but the
<a href="http://bit.ly/16ZUF27">new generation console war</a> seems already to be won by Sony.</p>
<p>Microsoft keeps shooting itself in the foot. They desperately try to innovate,
but it just won't
<a href="http://betanews.com/2010/02/09/why-former-employees-say-microsoft-can-t-innovate/">work</a>.
Instead of acknowledging the problem, they lie to themselves and keep on
trying. Which obviously results in things like Xbox One and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbWgUO-Rqcw">TV</a>.
And <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2273430/microsoft-confirms-always-on-xbox-one-requirements">requirement for internet connection at least once a
day</a>.
Or the most annoying of them all:
<a href="http://www.polygon.com/2013/5/27/4369252/xbox-one-will-be-region-locked">region-lock</a>.</p>
<p>So rather of listening to gamers and other real Xbox users so they could have
developed a truly awesome gaming console with new generation hardware, they
chose to try to innovate once again. And once again they failed.</p>
<p>Those 22 seconds above was all that it takes to make Xbox fanboys seriously
consider the alternative. Sony isn't just a little better, they seem to be
better in everything. And they have won the hearts of the gamers, leaving Microsoft with 
an average Jane who sooner or later realizes, that one big company has sold her a box 
which puts a TV inside her TV so she could watch TV on her TV. </p>
