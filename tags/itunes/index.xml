      <title>Can not select Airport Express remote speakers</title>

      <description>I have a first generation Airport Express which works flawlessly with iPad and iPhone. But when I try to select remote speakers from iTunes it deselects the tickbox as soon as I click on it. Usually osx restart helps, but it only lasts until I switch network or loose connectivity to wifi. Expressively inconvenient I have to say.
I&amp;rsquo;m not alone, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that there is a straightforward answer out there.</description>

      <title>Never ever buy a movie from iTunes</title>

      <description>Now this is getting ridiculous. When you buy a movie from iTunes you cannot watch this on your external screen. Yes, seriously. You can not plug in your second monitor, or your 1000$ 30&amp;quot; Apple Cinema Display, drag your iTunes window to that screen and hit play. It just won&amp;rsquo;t work.
And apparently it&amp;rsquo;s due to a thing called High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP). Something fancy that Apple added to all Macbook and Macbook Pro&amp;rsquo;s made after 2008.</description>
