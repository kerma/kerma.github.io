      <description>There is a simple task that I occasionally need to perform which has caused me many headaches during the past 10 years: send an email from a server. I remember a day in my early career where I spent hours and hours trying to get Exim4 configured. I’ve similar recollections with Postfix, Sendmail and ssmtp. The last being close to what I was initially hoping for to find. But even this had it’s issues.</description>

      <description>On my day job I use Chrome as my default browser and at home I roll with Safari. Occasionally I want to get work stuff done at home as well, with my personal laptop. Chrome profile sync works well for bookmarks, plugins and preferences, but opening links from email and chats in Safari while I&amp;rsquo;m in &amp;ldquo;work mode&amp;rdquo; is a bit annoying. Navigation to Chrome preferences to set it as the default, and later to remember to set Safari back seems a bit daft.</description>
