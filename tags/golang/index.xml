      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working with JSON in Go can be tricky. Specially if you&amp;rsquo;re coming from dynamic languages like Python or JavaScript,
where JSON encoding often &amp;ldquo;just works&amp;rdquo;. Over the years I had grown accustomed to
those conveniences and that made me overlook many details which affect JSON encoding
in Go. This guide hopefully helps me to avoid those mistakes in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>There is a simple task that I occasionally need to perform which has caused me many headaches during the past 10 years: send an email from a server. I remember a day in my early career where I spent hours and hours trying to get Exim4 configured. I’ve similar recollections with Postfix, Sendmail and ssmtp. The last being close to what I was initially hoping for to find. But even this had it’s issues.</description>
