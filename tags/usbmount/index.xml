      <description>After I got my ybercool home media server ready it was time to start using it properly. Which, for a sad reason, also meant that I had to occasionally copy some of my media to USB stick, to enjoy it also on my bedroom TV which is not connected to the network.
At some point I noticed that moving 1.4GB data from server hard drive to usb flash drive took like an hour.</description>
