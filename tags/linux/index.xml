      <description>After I got my ybercool home media server ready it was time to start using it properly. Which, for a sad reason, also meant that I had to occasionally copy some of my media to USB stick, to enjoy it also on my bedroom TV which is not connected to the network.
At some point I noticed that moving 1.4GB data from server hard drive to usb flash drive took like an hour.</description>

      <title>How to resize FAT partition in Linux without losing data</title>

      <description>I have a small external hard drive that had three partitions on it. One I created for TimeMachine backups, one for keeping movies and one that I was not aware of. It had a boot flag so I suspect it was created by TimeMachine itself.
So once I got a bigger HD just for TimeMachine I no longer needed the allocated 100GB on that older drive. Getting rid of it however without losing data seemed a bit too complicated in Mac OS X.</description>
