      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m designing an API. And obviously first question I had was: what&amp;rsquo;s the real difference between PUT and POST? Someone is always wrong in the internet. And there are a lot of opinions out there. But I think the most simple and clear on comes from stackoverflow:
PUT implies putting a resource - completely replacing whatever is available at the given URL with a different thing. By definition, a PUT is idempotent.</description>
