Adobe ever produced - you haven't met ColdFusion.
But there is a wallpaper - it must be awesome you say.
no. it was worse than PHP3. Worse than Javascript.
Luckily the project I worked with had some conventions.
so i was able to build an &quot;IDE&quot; which helped me to 
navigate this mess. And I realized that building something
like this completely on your own is not so difficult.
It's mostly just very unreasonable and useless for others.
OK, there are worse companies out there that Adobe, right?
